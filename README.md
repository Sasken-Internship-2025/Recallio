## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Android (Java)
- **Backend:** Firebase Authentication + Firebase Realtime Database
- **Other Integrations:** OTP Integration for safe login

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**
   - Users sign up using email and password with OTP verification.  
   - Firebase manages authentication sessions, allowing persistent logins.  

2. **Creating and Managing Notes**
   - Notes are stored under the authenticated userâ€™s UID in the Realtime Database.  
   - Users can add titles, content, labels, reminders, images, and checklists.  

3. **Real-Time Sync**
   - Any updates made on one device are instantly reflected on all devices logged into the same account.  

4. **Security**
   - Firebase Database Rules ensure that each user can only access their own notes.

## Firebase Database Rules Example

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "notes": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
````
